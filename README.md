# Stroke Prediction

This repository contains the code and data files for a stroke prediction project using classification models. The goal of this analysis is to explore and gain insights into the factors associated with strokes in a given dataset,
as well as develop models to make predictions on the possible occurence of stroke

## Overview
In this analysis, we investigate the relationship between various factors and the occurrence of strokes. By examining the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis, we aim to identify patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors associated with strokes.
It also includes several classifier models used to make a predition on the occurence of stroke.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on individuals, including their age, hypertension status, heart disease status, average glucose level, BMI, and stroke occurrence. This dataset forms the basis for our analysis and insights.
You can download a copy of the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code in this repository:
- Python 3
- Pandas
